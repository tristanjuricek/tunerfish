Tunerfish
=========

This is a simple tuner application. This is very pre-alpha at the moment.

I'd rather hold off on any further description.


To Do
=====

Experiment with a functional testing suite. Is it possible?

Can I get some kind of CI system running.

Refine the pitch display; the sharp cymbol looks kind of funny. We should probably consider
centering the text properly. Use FontMetrics to calculate the width of strings, and get those
strings into a resources file.

Figure out a nicer "octave range" representation.

The combo box selector needs work, it's still fugly. I'm not sure it's obvious this is the input
selector.
