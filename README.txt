Tunerfish
=========

This is a simple tuner application. This is very pre-alpha at the moment.

I'd rather hold off on any further description.


To Do
=====

Refine the pitch display; the sharp cymbol looks kind of funny. We should probably consider
centering the text properly. Use FontMetrics to calculate the width of strings, and get those
strings into a resources file.

Figure out a nicer "octave range" representation.

The combo box selector needs work, it's still fugly. I'm not sure it's obvious this is the input
selector.

This actually doesn't work on my typical Duet interface with the bass on only
one of the audio tracks. I'll need to investigate this.

Can we test audiosystem settings in the CI system?
